# How to Create a GraphQL API with AWS Database in 10 Easy Steps

GraphQL it's one of those technologies in the web development industry that is taking more relevance each day that goes by. It was released by Facebook in 2015 and has been well received by the community and gaining momentum with developers.

Here are some of the main advantages

It's fast, as it gives the client the ability to select only the fields it wants.
No URL confusion as it provides developers a single endpoint to work with.
Improve performance since you don't need to make that many requests.
It's self-documenting; GraphQL takes care of documenting your API so you can focus on what's really important.
No under-fetching or over-fetching as you only get the results need it for a specific scenario.
And even though it's not a perfect technology but with every new version, it gets better, to the point that some developers claimed to be better than Rest APIs. Personally, I like it since it allows the client to decide what it wants.

But how can we start taking advantage of GraphQL? Let's follow this easy tutorial to build our first GraphQL service to manage an app's users and connect it to a PostgreSQL database hosted in AWS.
